Unlike most computer programs that are used for bibliometric mapping, VOSviewer pays special attention to the graphical representation of bibliometric maps. The functionality of VOSviewer is especially useful for displaying large bibliometric maps in an easy-to-interpret way. The paper consists of three parts. In the first part, an overview of VOSviewer's functionality for displaying bibliometric maps is provided. In the second part, the technical implementation of specific parts of the program is discussed. Finally, in the third part, VOSviewer's ability to handle large maps is demonstrated by using the program to construct and display a co-citation map of 5,000 major scientific journals.},

abstract={Phase-field modeling offers a powerful tool for investigating the electrical control of the domain structure in ferroelectrics. However, its broad application is constrained by demanding computational requirements, limiting its utility in inverse design scenarios. Here, we introduce a machine-learning surrogate to accelerate 3D phase-field modeling of tip-induced electrical switching. By dynamically handling the boundary conditions, the surrogate achieves accurate reproduction of switching trajectories under various tip locations and applied voltages. With stable predictions throughout entire morphological evolution pathways and a relative error inferior to 10{\%} compared to direct solvers, the model efficiently emulates intricate switching sequences. By successfully replicating the boundary conditions, the presented framework strides towards a holistic surrogate for the ferroelectric phase field. With up to 2500-fold speed-ups over classical methods, our approach opens the path for the tractable design of the domain structure and the resolution of realistic inverse problems.},

abstract = {With aid of good materials descriptors, machine learning algorithms are able to accelerate the design of new materials and uncover underlying mechanisms. In the present study, we adopt machine learning methods to discover the most important materials descriptors for properties of ferroelectric materials. A regression study, in typical BaTiO3-based and K1/2Na1/2NbO3-based lead-free ceramics and lead-contained PbMg1/3Nb2/3TiO3-PbTiO3 ceramics, screens out three important materials descriptors determining ferroelectricity from 46 potential descriptors. The three descriptors of Matyonov-Batsanov electronegativity, ratio of valence electron number to nominal charge and core electron distance (Schubert) are confirmed to be dominant as well in classification of perovskite compounds into antiferroelectrics or not. The classification based on these descriptors exhibit an excellent accuracy of 96%, much higher than that of traditional criterion (89%) using tolerance factor and Pauling electronegativity. Furthermore, we propose a machine learning strategy based on our descriptors to predict the phase coexistence. The prediction probability after bootstrapping provides an effective approach to distinguish the phase boundaries and predict the phase ratio of coexisted phases. In all, we identified materials descriptors for ferroelectric materials, which is helpful to reveal the structure-property relationship of ferroelectric materials and guide the design of better ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity.}

abstract={The regular twinning in ceramics and metals below the temperature of a ferroelastic or ferroelectric structural phase transition is a result of energy minimization. Here homogeneous elastic energy is reduced at the expense of twin wall energy. The twin density depends on the gram sizeg; under homogeneous stress the total elastic energy of a grain increases ∝g3. Any kind of twin wall, however, increases ∝g2. Below the intersection of these two curves, stress reduction by twinning cannot lower the total energy. Thus there is a critical grain size below which twinning should not occur. Above this limit the width of the twin lamellae increases ∝g1/2. The shape of the grain then adjusts to the surroundings in two dimensions only. Above another larger critical grain size more complex interfaces with higher surface energy are created, which allow stress relief in the third dimension. A semi-quantitative model is developed with the example of BaTiO3 ceramic, of which the domain patterns are well known. It is representative for many ceramics. The highTc superconductor YBa2Cu3O7−$\delta$ also twins according to the same law. For three-dimensional adjustment here a proper interface is missing.},

abstract = {Polar domain walls in centrosymmetric ferroelastics (e.g., BiVO4 films) give rise to inhomogeneity and offer promises for solar energy conversion applications via expediting charge-carrier separation. However, the origin of polar domain walls and the relationship between them and spontaneous strain from structural phase transition remain elusive at the mesoscale in BiVO4 films. Here, from the perspective of phenomenological thermodynamics, the relationship between four variants of monoclinic (M) phase and the corresponding lattice parameters during the tetragonal-monoclinic (T-M) phase transition is revealed. Using phase-field simulations, it suggests that the formation of four variants of ferroelastic twin domains arises from spontaneous strain from T-M phase transition. Moreover, it is demonstrated that (i) polar domain walls in BiVO4 films originate from the flexoelectric effect induced by strain gradient across the domain walls during phase transition process; (ii) shear strain gradient dominates the contribution to the polarization vectors at the domain walls; (iii) 180° head-to-head or tail-to-tail in-plane polarization configurations emerge at the adjacent domain walls. The stability of several types of ferroelastic domain walls is also analyzed from the point of view of total free energy. These results not only provide a fundamental understanding of the origin of polar domain walls and the formation mechanisms of ferroelastic twin patterns, but also stimulate potential applications of polar domain walls of non-polar BiVO4 films in energy conversion.}

A complete compression-tension hysteresis loop is simulated, and the results show the nucleation of new domains at domain walls (DW). Due to relaxation of strain energy, the coherent DWs of the surviving domains often form features like steps, crevices and corners, and nucleation of new domains primarily takes place at these sites in a repeated fashion. The change in elastic strain energy around these sites is sufficient to provide the energy necessary for ferroelastic domain nucleation (FDN). The present simulations reveal that the apparent ellipsoidal shape of a nucleus might be an oblate spheroid when the nucleation takes place at a crevice. The present work also reveals that nucleation of triangular shaped domains is equally probable, and they take place at the steps or corners of DWs.}

Simulations are performed under uniaxial tension and compression using realistic domain microstructures. This work provides new insights into the mechanism of ferroelastic deformation by studying the evolution of domains under different loading directions and strain rates. The model predicts realistic stress-strain curves consisting of stress-plateaus with accurate domain switching behavior without setting a switching criterion based on a critical stress for nucleation of new domains. The results reveal that the origin of coercive stress lies in the balance between the energy absorbed by the domain switching process and the externally applied energy. Loading in different directions but parallel to the spontaneous strain results in different levels of coercive stress as domain switching absorbs different amounts of energy. For the same reason when the strain-rate increases, the coercive stress also increases. This work establishes the relation between the coercive stress and microstructural changes during ferroelastic domain switching.}

In this study, we perform phase-field simulations of ferroelastic domain switching in yttria-stabilized zirconia to investigate the kinetics of domain switching. For a wide range of applied loads, the kinetics of domain switching follows the Kolmogorov-Avrami-Ishibashi (KAI) model. The domain wall velocity remains constant under a constant load but accelerates when the load is gradually increased over time. The steady movement of domain wall is observed to dominate the kinetics of ferroelastic domain switching. The present study reveals that during switching, some degree of back-switching simultaneously may occur depending upon the applied load and microstructures. Also, sharp corners on domain walls intensify the switching activity, and they often promote back-switching during loading, leading to incomplete domain switching. Increase in back-switching is subsequently followed by another re-switching event that ultimately results in a large deviation from KAI model and a greater absorption of applied deformation.}

ABSTRACT={<p>Twins, as a special structure, have been observed in a small number of experiments on ferroelectrics. A good understanding of the morphologies of twins is very important for twin engineering applications in ferroelectric materials. In this work, the morphologies of twins in tetragonal ferroelectrics are investigated using the compatibility analysis of the transformation strains and spontaneous polarization and the energetic analysis. The tetragonal BaTiO<sub>3</sub> single crystal is chosen as an example for the material system. The results show that the lamellar twin structures with <inline-formula id="inf1"><mml:math id="m1" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced open="{" close="}" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>111</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> as the twin plane have been identified by both compatibility analysis and energetic analysis, which is consistent with the experimental observations.

Furthermore, stable state uncharged twin boundaries and metastable charged twin boundaries are distinguished by energetic analysis, where the spontaneous polarization is compatible across the uncharged twin boundaries, while it is not compatible across the charged twin boundaries. The results predicted by the compatibility analysis and energetic analysis are consistent, thus providing a pathway for understanding the morphologies of twins.</p>}}

Both the single twins and double lamellar twins are growth (or annealing) twins. The twins lying in the {111} mirror planes, which is not one of the symmetry elements of the (basic) crystal lattice's but that of the superlattice's, are therefore superlattice twins. The {111} twins, particularly the double twins, were found more frequently from samples sintered in an Ar atmosphere of lower oxygen partial pressure (pO2). Further decreasing of pO2 using the Ar-5\% H2 mixture has rendered the sintered samples entirely of hexagonal BaTiO3, the 6H-polytype. The formation of such twins is attributed to changing of the corner-sharing TiO6 octahedra to Ti2O9 face-sharing octahedra, which accommodates for local oxygen deficiency in tetragonal BaTiO3. The stacking sequence alters accordingly from c-layer (constituting the 3C-polytype, treating tetragonal pseudo-cubic) to h-layer (as in (chc)1(chc)2 of 6H).},

First, DFT-derived parameters establish predictive volcano models for various electrochemical reactions, linking atomic-scale descriptors to macroscopic performance within the framework of low-dimensional data science. Meanwhile, with the development of large-scale datasets, ML deciphers complex structure–property relationships, accelerating the design of promising electrocatalysts. Additionally, machine learning potentials (MLPs) bridge quantum precision and scalability, not only accelerating thermodynamic adsorption energy calculations but also enabling simulations of dynamic catalytic mechanisms more efficiently. Finally, we discuss emerging opportunities to deepen data science’s impact. This mini-review highlights the transformative role of data science in bridging theoretical insights, computational efficiency, and experimental validation, ultimately accelerating the design of next-generation electrocatalysts for a sustainable energy future.}

This high versatility makes them useful in enabling components such as capacitors, sensors, and actuators. Key parameters to tune their dielectric, piezoelectric, and electromechanical performance are the domain structure and the dynamic of the domain walls. In fixed compositions, this is often realized by chemical doping. In addition, structural and microstructural parameters, such as grain size, degree of crystallographic texture and porosity play a key role. An important step forward in the field was the fundamental understanding of the link between the local electric and mechanical driving forces and domain wall motion. Here, the impact of crystal structure and microstructure on these driving forces is reviewed and an engineering toolbox is introduced. An overview of advances in the understanding of domain wall motion on the micro- and nanoscale is provided and discussed in terms of the macroscopic functional performance of polycrystalline ferroelectrics/ferroelastics. In addition, a link to theoretical and computational models is established. The review concludes with a discussion about beyond state-of-the-art characterization techniques, new approaches, and future directions toward non-conventionally ordered ferroelectrics for next-generation nanoelectronic and energy-storage applications.}

We found that in depolarized samples, there exists a threshold electric field for the phase changes, whereas in polarized samples, no such threshold exists. The profound difference in the diffraction profile changes under positive and negative electric fields in polarized samples is responsible for the asymmetry of piezoelectric effects. Peak fitting results show phase transition as well as domain switching at different electric-field levels.

Preexisting ferroelastic domains have been shown to inhibit 180° switching in (001)-oriented epitaxial Pb(Zr0.2,Ti0.8)O3 (PZT) films, but ferroelectric switching pathways around these domains remain unclear. Here, phase field modeling with supporting high resolution transmission electron microscopy is used to investigate ferroelectric switching in PZT thin films around such a ferroelastic domain. We show 180° domain wall motion is arrested at moderate applied biases by the ferroelastic domain through formation of charged 90° domain walls during switching. This leads to an increased applied bias required for complete switching through the thin film. Charged 90° ferroelastic domain walls are found to be partially stabilized by local rotation of the polarization direction and significant broadening of the head-to-head wall to distribute the bound charge, leading to domain walls 5–6 nm in thickness compared to 0.5–2 nm for typical 90° domain walls. Ferroelectric switching continues only at higher applied electric fields. This study provides a more complete picture of the ferroelectric switching pathway around ferroelastic domains than has been previously available and may explain the experimentally observed lower stability of written domain structures around preexisting ferroelastic domain structures in epitaxial ferroelectric thin films.}

The development of new classes of electronic, energy-storage, and information-technology devices depends critically on understanding and controlling field-induced polarization switching. Polarization reversal is controlled by defects that determine activation energy, critical switching bias, and the selection between thermodynamically equivalent polarization states in multiaxial ferroelectrics. Understanding and controlling defect functionality in ferroelectric materials is as critical to the future of oxide electronics and solid-state electrochemistry as defects in semiconductors are for semiconductor electronics. Here, recent advances in understanding the defect-mediated switching mechanisms, enabled by recent advances in electron and scanning probe microscopy, are discussed. The synergy between local probes and structural methods offers a pathway to decipher deterministic polarization switching mechanisms on the level of a single atomically defined defect.},

abstract = {In situ Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) techniques can potentially fill in gaps in the current understanding interfacial phenomena in complex oxides. Select multiferroic oxide materials, such as BiFeO3 (BFO), exhibit ferroelectric and magnetic order, and the two order parameters are coupled through a quantum–mechanical exchange interaction. The magneto-electric coupling in BFO allows control of the ferroelectric and magnetic domain structures via applied electric fields. Because of these unique properties, BFO and other magneto-electric multiferroics constitute a promising class of materials for incorporation into devices such as high-density ferroelectric and magnetoresistive memories, spin valves, and magnetic field sensors. The magneto-electric coupling in BFO is mediated by volatile ferroelastically switched domains that make it difficult to incorporate this material into devices. To facilitate device integration, an understanding of the microstructural factors that affect ferroelastic relaxation and ferroelectric domain switching must be developed. In this article, a method of viewing ferroelectric (and ferroelastic) domain dynamics using in situ biasing in TEM is presented. The evolution of ferroelastically switched ferroelectric domains in BFO thin films during many switching cycles is investigated. Evidence of partial domain nucleation, propagation, and switching even at applied electric fields below the estimated coercive field is revealed. Our observations indicate that the occurrence of ferroelastic relaxation in switched domains and the stability of these domains is influenced the applied field as well as the BFO microstructure. These biasing experiments provide a real time view of the complex dynamics of domain switching and complement scanning probe techniques. Quantitative information about domain switching under bias in ferroelectric and multiferroic materials can be extracted from in situ TEM to provide a predictive tool for future device development.}

ABSTRACT = {The improvement in energy storage performance of ferroelectric (FE) materials requires both high electric breakdown strength and significant polarization change. The phase-field method can couple the multi-physics-field factors. It can realize the simulation of electric breakdown and polarization evolution. It is widely used to reveal the modification mechanism and guide experimental design. Starting with the models of electric breakdown and polarization evolution, this work reviews the latest theoretical progress on FE materials with high energy storage performance. Firstly, the enhancement mechanisms of electric breakdown strength are analyzed. Subsequently, the improvement strategies at domain scales are analyzed. Finally, this review summarizes and looks ahead to the development of theoretical models, such as machine learning models.},

Chalupsk\'{y} et al., Opt. Express 18, 27836 (2010)\]. The method exploits ablative imprints in various solids to visualize iso-fluence beam contours at different fluence and/or clip levels. An f-scan curve (clip level as a function of the corresponding iso-fluence contour area) can be generated for a general non-Gaussian beam. As shown in this paper, fluence scan encompasses important information about energy distribution within the beam profile, which may play an essential role in laser-matter interaction research employing intense non-ideal beams. Here we for the first time discuss fundamental properties of the f-scan function and its inverse counterpart (if-scan). Furthermore, we extensively elucidate how it is related to the effective beam area, energy distribution, and to the so called Liu's dependence \[J. M. Liu, Opt. Lett. 7, 196 (1982)\]. A new method of the effective area evaluation based on weighted inverse f-scan fit is introduced and applied to real data obtained at the SCSS (SPring-8 Compact SASE Source) facility.},

The complex physical phenomenon causing the formation of keyhole has not been considered. The temperature histories of welding process were studied. It was observed that the finite volume thermal model was in good agreement with the experimental data. Also, we predicted the temperature as a function of distance at different laser welding speeds and saw that at each welding speed, the temperature profile was decreased sharply in points close to the laser beam center, and then decreased slightly in the far region from the laser beam center. The model prediction error was found to be in the 2–17% range with most numerical values falling within 7% of the experimental values.}

It was found that microstructure of the studied alloys is composed of large, plate-like grains of Ag3Sn intermetallic phase in the Sn-rich eutectic matrix. Phase transition temperatures and corresponding heat effects were experimentally determined and compared with the results of thermodynamic and phase equilibria calculations using the CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagrams) method and optimized thermodynamic parameters from literature. The xenon flash method was employed for the measurements of thermal diffusivity and determination of thermal conductivity in the temperature range from 25 to 150 °C. The results show that the thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity gradually decrease with increasing temperature. The determined values of thermal conductivities of the investigated alloys are very close to each other and only slightly higher than that of pure tin. The contributions of electrons and phonons to the thermal conductivity of the studied alloys at room temperature were determined using the Wiedemann-Franz law and the obtained values of the thermal and electrical conductivities. The percentage contributions of the phonon component to the thermal conductivity for Sn–10% Ag and Sn–20% Ag alloys at 25 °C were found to be 20.5% and 28.9%, respectively.}

The density and surface tension measurements were conducted in the temperature range from 230 to 950 {\textdegree}C, and the meniscographic investigations were carried out at 252 {\textdegree}C. The resultant values of surface tension were compared with those calculated from Butler's model based on optimized thermodynamic parameters and our data from earlier investigations. In an earlier study, experimental data for all investigated compositions (Cu at. {\%}=1.08 to 6.5) exhibit an increase in the surface tension with interesting temperature, while both ternary alloys of this study show a slight lowering tendency in comparison to (Sn-Ag)eut. A more evident decreasing tendency of surface tension and interfacial tension was noted in meniscographic measurements, noting that data of interfacial tension are always lower than surface tension due to the role of the flux. Eight different fluxes were tested to select the lowest interfacial tension for the (Sn-Ag)eut. ROLI (3{\%} solids), which is the alcoholic solution of organic compounds and rosin activated by halogens, was recommended.

Experiments were performed to solder joints with thickness from 50 $\mu$m to 2 mm. The intermetallic compound (IMC) growth rate of solder joints is found to be dependent on the size of solder joints. After soldering procedure, the IMC of smaller size solder joints is thinner than that of larger size solder joints. It is also found that the average grain size of IMC increases with decreasing of the joint size. To better understand the difference of IMC growth during solid-state and liquid-state thermal aging, experiments were performed at 210 and 300 {\textdegree}C, respectively. IMC thickness of solder joints after 210 and 300 {\textdegree}C of thermal aging was measured. It is found that the size effect on IMC growth rate at solid-state and liquid-state is different. The IMC growth rate of smaller size solder joints is higher than larger size solder joints under solid-state thermal aging. Under liquid-state reaction, the IMC growth rate of smaller size solder joints is slower. `H' type and hexagonal prism of Cu6Sn5 were observed in 2 and 1 mm thickness size solder joint, respectively. Fewer Cu6Sn5 prism was found in 50 $\mu$m thickness solder joints. Tensile strengths of solder joints with different sizes were measured. The solder joints showed ductile to brittle fracture transition with the decreasing of joints thickness. The H-field fracture criterion is employed to predict the tensile strength of Sn3.0Ag0.5Cu solder joints with different thickness.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of the Internet of Things and flexible electronics, piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs) based on polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) have demonstrated a wide range of potential applications in wearable devices. However, there are still challenges in developing high-performance PENGs, which affect their potential applications in more scenarios. Herein, we propose a SnO2-PVDF (SP)-PENG based on low-cost and environment-friendly SnO2 nanoparticles modulated via electrospinning, achieving outstanding piezoelectric output performance. The piezoelectric output of SP-PENG is up to 49.2 V, which is 11.7 times higher than that of pure PVDF-PENG. From the theoretical perspective, the enhanced electrostatic polarization is achieved by the strengthened local electric field due to the presence of low-resistivity SnO2 in the SP fibers. The mechanism of enhanced electrostatic polarization is also declared by COMSOL simulation. Moreover, the SP-PENG exhibits excellent durability (41,600 cycles) and long-term stability (8 months). A self-powered wireless sensing-monitoring system is realized by combining SP-PENG with circuit design. The motion recognition system is accomplished by integrating an assistance of a 1D CNN-LSTM joint learning model, which is verified by an alphabetic handwriting recognition with a classification accuracy up to 100 %. This study provides significant insights for enhancing the performance of PENGs and offers valuable guidance for exploring the application of PENGs in flexible electronics and artificial intelligence.}

This paper focuses on revealing the binding mechanism of PVDF by the simulation calculation using density function theory (DFT) and the analyses of the binding surfaces in LIBs. The results of the process simulation and theoretical calculation indicate that the binding interactions between LiFePO4 (LFP) and PVDF are much stronger than that between PVDF and Al in LFP batteries, whereas, the binding interactions between Li(Ni1-x-yCoxMny)O2 (NCM) and PVDF are weaker than that between PVDF and Al in NCM batteries. Scanning electron microscopy and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) analyses indicate that PVDF are mainly distributed on the surfaces of LFP in LFP batteries, however, PVDF distribute uniformly between Al and NCM in NCM batteries. In addition, AES analyses indicate that no chemical interaction among the surfaces of active materials, PVDF, and Al, both in LFP and NCM batteries. This study provides a foundation for the development of new binders and the peeling of active materials in LIBs.}

ABSTRACT = {Piezoelectric structures are widely used in engineering designs including sensors, actuators, and energy-harvesting devices. In this paper, we present the development of a three-dimensional finite element model for simulations of piezoelectric actuators and quantification of their responses under uncertain parameter inputs. The implementation of the finite element model is based on standard nodal approach extended for piezoelectric materials using three-dimensional tetrahedral and hexahedral elements. To account for electrical-mechanical coupling in piezoelectric materials, an additional degree of freedom for electrical potential is added to each node in those elements together with their usual mechanical displacement unknowns. The development was validated with analytical and experimental data for a range of problems from a single-layer piezoelectric beam to multiple layer beams in unimorph and bimorph arrangement. A more detailed analysis is conducted for a unimorph composite plate actuator with different design parameters. Uncertainty quantification was also performed to evaluate the sensitivity of the responses of the piezoelectric composite plate with an uncertain input of material properties. This sheds light on understanding the variations in reported responses of the device; at the same time, providing extra confidence to the numerical model.},

abstract = {Sensors and actuators made of materials whose characteristics may be modified by external parameters have a wide range of uses. Piezoelectric materials come under this category that can convert mechanical energy to electrical energy and vice versa. In our daily lives, we come across a piezoelectric effect whether we realize it or not. To name a few are the piezo igniters for cooking, ultrasonic parking sensors, piezo buzzers in alarm clocks, and mobile phones. Any device can be modeled analytically in order to predict its behavior based on the fundamental theory that drives it. For the modeling of ultrasonic devices, the finite element approach is commonly employed, and commercial software are available. ANSYS' coupled field analysis allows you to evaluate the interaction between two fields. Static, modal, harmonic, and transient analyses are possible with regard to piezoelectric analysis. This paper presents the modal analysis of piezoelectric structures that enables the determination of the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the structure. The natural frequency thus obtained is verified with harmonic analysis.}

abstract = {Nowadays, energy harvesting is widely used in several sectors, including automobile, civil and industrial systems. It’s about improving their energy efficiency and reducing their carbon footprint. Harvesting energy from environmental vibrations is achievable today due to natural oscillations such as the flow of air or liquids, the exhalation or the human body motion. This vibration frequency is generally low. Consequently, energy harvesting systems based on low frequency vibrations are an important research topic, as they can be used to power up portable or implantable devices. In this paper, a simulation of piezoelectric energy harvester is investigated using finite element method. The harvester is composed of a piezoelectric polymer (PVDF), and a flexible substrate (PVC). Based on simulation results, the maximum output power, the displacement and the output voltage are achieved at 0.19 µW, 49 µm and 1 V, respectively, at low resonant frequency of 0.3 Hz.}

The motivation and strategic objectives are to breakthrough dynamic time-varying impacting load measuring fundamental technologies in steel ball forging process. The structure of piezoelectric film force sensor is proposed. The theoretical calculation formula of natural frequency is deduced and calculated by using MATLAB software. The mechanical performance analysis on dynamic model and structural optimization simulation by FEM is carried out. In order to study the validity of the proposed method, a prototype of the sensor is fabricated. The static and dynamic calibration devices are designed to realize calibration experiments on the fabricated PVDF piezoelectric film force sensor. The differences among experimental value, simulation value and the theoretical value are given. The nonlinear error of the fabricated sensor is 0.197%. The sensor’s first order natural frequency value is 5238 Hz. It is proved that the PVDF piezoelectric film force sensor has superior dynamic performance and high accuracy for measuring deformation in steel ball. The paper will provide important scientific basis and technical foundation to achieve superior performance steel ball.}
